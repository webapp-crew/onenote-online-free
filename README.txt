# onenote-online-free
A nw.js encapsuled version of OneNote Online

This project provides you with necessary files to run OneNote Online as a "native client" (or "glorified bookmark") in a dedicaded nw.js instance.

Source of Inspiration comes from: 
- the td.nw.js client: Exaclty the same concept, predated the creation of this repository.

- "Linux Web Apps project": They seemed to have made this as an installable ubuntu package that adds the links to the WebApps to the Ubuntu Menu but the file is not longer available... Also it used the main browser, which may be suboptimal in some cases - espechally if seamless user experience is wanted.
